My step to get to my answer:

SELECT * FROM "crime_scene_reports"
WHERE "year" = '2023' AND "month" = '7' AND "day" = '28' AND "street"  = 'Humphrey Street' AND "description" LIKE '%the CS50 duck%';
SELECT * FROM "interviews"
WHERE "year" = '2023' AND "month" = '7' AND "day" = '28' AND "transcript" LIKE '%thief%';
SELECT * FROM "bakery_security_logs"
WHERE "year" = '2023' AND "month" = '7' AND "day" = '28' AND "activity" = 'exit' and "hour" = '10' AND "minute" BETWEEN '15' AND '25';
SELECT * FROM "people"
WHERE "license_plate" = '94KL13X';
SELECT * FROM "passengers"
WHERE  "passport_number" = (
	SELECT "passport_number" FROM "people"
	WHERE "license_plate" = '94KL13X'
	);
SELECT * FROM "flights"
WHERE "id" = (
	SELECT "flight_id" FROM "passengers"
	WHERE "flight_id" = '36'
	);
SELECT * FROM "airports"
WHERE "id" = (
	SELECT "destination_airport_id" FROM "flights"
	WHERE "destination_airport_id" = '4'
	);
SELECT * FROM "phone_calls"
WHERE "caller" = (
	SELECT "phone_number" FROM "people"
	WHERE "phone_number" = '(367) 555-5533'
	) AND "day" = '28' AND "duration" BETWEEN '0' AND '60';
SELECT * FROM "people"
WHERE "phone_number" = (
	SELECT "receiver" FROM "phone_calls"
	WHERE "receiver" = '(375) 555-8161'
	);

So my answer:

The city which the thief escaped to New York City.
The person who help the thief to escaped is Robin.
